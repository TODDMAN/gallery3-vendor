DESCRIPTION
-----------
SWFObject (http://code.google.com/p/swfobject) is an easy-to-use and
standards-friendly method to embed Flash content, which utilizes one small
JavaScript file. There are three directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the swfobject svn tree
  http://swfobject.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

generator:
  This is a standalone html page that allows for the generation of the html
  code to use on the page.

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/modules/swfobject/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!
$ git commit -m "Updated to SWFObject r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated to SWFObject r<REVISION_NUMBER>"
$ git push
$ cp modified/swfobject.js ../../gallery3/lib/


$ cd ../../gallery3
$ git commit -m "Updated to SWFObject r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modules/lib
$ git push

This is the vendor branch for Gallery 3.  Any external resources (code,
utilities, scripts, etc) that we use in Gallery 3 are stored here.  By
keeping a copy, when the upstream code changes, we can figure out what
changed and apply that as a patch to the Gallery 3 version.  This
allows us to modify our version in Gallery 3 and not lose our changes
when there's a new version upstream.

There are two types of packages.  The ones where we don't actually
modify them in Gallery 3, and the ones where we do.  Any package that
we modify in Gallery 3 has its own README.  Here we list all the
packages that WE DO NOT MODIFY.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the kohanamodules svn tree
  http://source.kohanaphp.com/trunk

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/trunk/kohana


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # after updating filters you should do:
  #  $ rm -rf modified && svn up modified && sh refresh_modified.sh
  # when you're satisfied, svn commit modified
$ git commit -m "Updated modified to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3/modules/forge -p3
$ git push

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ git commit -m "Updated Forge to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modules/forge
$ git push

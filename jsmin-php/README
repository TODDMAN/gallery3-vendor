DESCRIPTION
-----------
There is one directory:

upstream:
  This is a pure copy of jsmin-php 1.1.1 from http://code.google.com/p/jsmin-php

UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh

NOTES
-----
We don't currently use this in the Gallery 3 code directly.  We do use it to
minify the jquery-ui.js as part of the refresh process.

$ wget http://minify.googlecode.com/files/minify_2.1.3.zip
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh    # Pay attention to the Kohana revision number.
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

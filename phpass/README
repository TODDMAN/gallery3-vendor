DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure copy of PHPass 0.1 from http://www.openwall.com/phpass/

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what we need in gallery3/trunk/modules/user/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<VERSION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

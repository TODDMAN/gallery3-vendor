VERIFYING PATCHES
-----------------

The following patches have been applied.  I expect with the next release 1.8 most of these patches will disappear for selectable:
http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4441: Mousedown on scrollbar start selectable
http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4377: Wrong offset when using appendTo
gallery_selectable1: Make it draggable and selectable work together.  This allows ctrl-click to work properly.
